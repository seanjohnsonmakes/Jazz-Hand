# Jazz-Hand
Created by: Sean Johnson and Otto Benson

IMPORTNANT: THIS PROJECT REQUIRES THE POWER NOTE LIBRARY https://github.com/seanjohnsonmakes/PowerNote

Jazz Hand is a wearable glove apparatus that gives users dynamic control over assignable MIDI parameters. It uses flex sensors and an accelerometer to interpret your finger movement and hand motions. 

The flex sensors in our code serve a binary purpose and activate notes. However, they could potentially be reprogrammed to control continuous parameters.
